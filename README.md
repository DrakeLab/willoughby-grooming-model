### Abstract: 

Abstract: Individual hosts serve as island habitats for ectoparasites like fleas that exploit their hosts for food and habitat, and between which parasites must disperse. Hosts defend themselves by limiting exposure to ectoparasites or reducing parasite loads via grooming. Despite the patchiness of host habitats and ubiquitousness of host behavioral defenses, ectoparasites are pervasive, reaching high infection prevalence across thousands of host species. The distributions of ectoparasite loads within populations, however, are rarely uniform and tend to follow the “80:20” rule: 80% of individuals are never infested or have low burdens, whereas 20% of individuals host high burdens and are responsible for the bulk of transmission. Processes that underlie the 80:20 rule are complex and remain elusive for many host-parasite interactions. . Here we develop a mathematical model to investigate how parasite demographic stochasticity  through the Allee effect and host regulation of parasites via grooming can drive heterogeneity in ectoparasite burdens. To do so, we integrate invasion biology, individual-based models of animal behavior, and theoretical population ecology to calculate the stationary distribution of ectoparasite population sizes using discrete models. We manipulate key population metrics, notably parasite immigration rate and carrying capacity, to describe behavioral coping of parasite infestations. Model outcomes translate stationary distributions of ectoparasite population sizes to variable parasite loads across a host population.  Lastly, we explore how changes in the host population size due to environmental fluctuations in resource availability feedback on the distribution of ectoparasite populations. 

### Background: 

Grooming is a ubiquitous behavior across vertebrates critical for the removal of ectoparasites. Despite empirical studies showcasing flexible grooming responses to variable parasite burdens due to treatment (Eads, Biggins, and Eads 2017), our understanding of the regulatory role grooming plays in host-ectoparasite dynamics is lacking. Here, we leverage field-derived parameters of rodent-flea studies to build simulated ectoparasite transmission models that incorporate this behavioral defense (BD). We will assess BD impacts on both individual infestation status and dynamic infestation intensities, along with mechanisms that may influence BD efficiency such as access to resources or temperature. This work not only showcases the impacts that BDs impose on parasites, but also begins to fill a conceptual gap in understanding of parasites as part of food webs (Johnson et al. 2010).  

Hosts can dramatically reduce ectoparasite infestations through defense behaviors such as scratching, biting, licking, or otherwise removing their parasites. In experimental studies that prohibit animals from grooming, like through the use of an Elizabethan collar, non-grooming individuals host significantly more parasites (Eckstein and Hart 2000). Grooming, however, is a costly behavior, that may be constrained by other energy expenditures such as parasite-induced immune defenses (Kam et al. 2010). Further, over-grooming can lead to secondary skin infections or weakened thermoregulatory capability due to hair loss (Mooring and Samuel 1999). Therefore, while grooming alone impacts ectoparasites, a more fruitful and realistic assessment will include interacting energetic requirements that determine grooming abundance. 

Resources can have complex consequences on host-ectoparasite dynamics. Changes in resources can have direct consequences on both host and ectoparasite vital rates. Indirectly, food density can change the frequency and context of host contact, promoting aggressive bouts or host range residency. This greater host density would in turn promote higher ectoparasite burdens (Krasnov et al 2002). Importantly, resources may mediate trade-offs between anti-parasitic behaviors and critical behaviors like vigilance or foraging. Abundant and accessible resources can decrease foraging time and allow more time for antiparasitic behaviors (Fehlmann et al. 2017); vice versa, parasite pressures that require anti-parasitic behaviors may decrease time available for foraging (Fritzsche and Allan 2012). Although these resource-induced consequences of host-parasite trends have been explored through a meta-analysis (Becker et al. 2018), ectoparasite studies only make up a small component (16%, 10/61 studies) of the literature compared to microparasites like bacteria. Addressing ectoparasite responses to host resource access may be particularly important as this taxon group likely responds differently than microparasites, where well provisioned hosts typically showcase increased infections (ibid). 

Considering the public health and ecological relevance of food provisioning of wildlife for vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as West Nile virus, Lyme disease and plague, we propose a mathematical model to investigate how behavioral defenses, specifically grooming, alter the distribution and dynamics of ectoparasite burdens under different resources scenarios.
